      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Framework, which classifies and creates chains of events for certain kinds of hacker behavior, Initial Access is one of the first tactics used in an attack. It’s sort of self-explanatory—it describes how the attacker first got into a system. I’m just learning about these concepts, so I wanted to start from the beginning. I’m interested in a few techniques, and I’ll go over them in my next few posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 26, 2020, a hacker group identified by Microsoft as &lt;strong&gt;Nobelium&lt;/strong&gt; launched what is widely considered the biggest supply chain hack of the 21st century. Known as the &lt;strong&gt;SolarWinds Hack&lt;/strong&gt;, this event wasn’t significant because it affected a single company—it was significant because it compromised software used by thousands of organizations, including 6 U.S. federal agencies. The attackers accessed sensitive internal communications, email systems, and identity systems, potentially for months without detection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
