As some of you may know, I have a deep interest in both meditation and yoga—specifically yogic philosophy, or the "yogic sciences," as they’re sometimes called. I think a lot of the progress I’ve found in my life can be attributed to the tantric and yogic practices I’ve learned and developed over time, and I want to spend some time sharing one of them here.

## Mantra

While I have no credentials in yoga or tantra, I’ve learned a lot on my own about these esoteric concepts, so I’ll give a brief background on **mantra** and how it works—at least how I understand it. Then I’ll go into my experience with the mantra "Aum Namah Shivaya."

The term **mantra** roughly translates to "instrument of the mind." From the outside, it usually looks like chanting some set of syllables repeatedly for a period of time, which may or may not lead to a noticeable effect. There are all kinds of mantras—some more potent and focused, others more general. But in my experience, they all tend to follow the same basic guidelines if you want them to *work* for you.

### Guidelines

1. Do not discuss the mantra  
2. Do not change the mantra  
3. Chant the mantra with reverence  
4. Chant the mantra without mind  
5. Let the mantra guide you  

These aren’t rules with consequences—they’re just pointers to avoid certain common pitfalls. And like most things in meditation, you’ll probably bump into those on your own anyway and learn through doing.

Now, I’m not here to “convince” anyone of anything—because that doesn't really work with this kind of stuff. I’m just sharing what has worked for me.

I’ve chanted two mantras consistently: **"Aum Namah Shivaya"** and **"Aum Kreem Kalikaye Namah."** This post is about the first one.

## Structure of the Mantra: *Aum Namah Shivaya*

This mantra is known as the **Panchakshara Mantra**, which means “five syllables” (Na, Ma, Shi, Va, Ya). Each syllable is said to correspond to one of the five elements, and in Shaiva traditions, chanting it is a way to align yourself with the fundamental building blocks of existence.

When chanted in full—**Aum Namah Shivaya**—the phrase roughly translates to “I bow down to Shiva” or “I bow to my inner Self.” Here’s how I understand its structure:

### 1. **AUM (ॐ)** – The Seed Sound (Beeja)

This is the energetic ignition. AUM is considered the original vibration—the sound from which everything arises. It’s typically chanted by opening the mouth fully, then letting the sound travel as the mouth slowly closes. It sets the tone and centers you.

### 2. **Namah (नमः)** – The Offering or Surrender

Namah means “I bow” or “salutations.” Not in a groveling sense, but more like a release—an offering of the ego. This part can feel strange if you’re skeptical, but in my experience it’s essential to feeling any real effect.

### 3. **Shivaya (शिवाय)** – The Invocation

Shivaya means “to Shiva.” But not as a figure in the sky—Shiva here refers to the formless, the stillness, the part of existence that’s unchanging and beyond identity. To me, it feels like aligning with the part of myself that just *is*—that watches, without moving.

People chant **Aum Namah Shivaya** for a reason—it doesn’t require belief in a god, or a religion, or anything outside yourself. You could say it requires *faith*, but not in the traditional sense. More like the kind of faith it takes to go to the gym—you go, and eventually things change. 

This mantra can’t really be studied through science, but the overwhelming number of people—especially in India—who’ve practiced it and reported positive effects was enough for me to give it a fair try.

## My Experience & Effects

I really couldn’t have predicted the effects this mantra would have on me. I still don’t know how much of my growth is directly from it, but I think it’s a sizeable portion. Most meditation practices take months of effort before you notice anything—and they usually require a certain temperament.

This mantra kind of “came to me” during a meditation—as weird as that sounds—and I felt almost *called* to keep doing it. I don’t think that’s a common experience, and I’d guess mine is probably an outlier. I have no idea if this will work for anyone else.

When I chant it, I feel like it aligns me with the **divine masculine energy** within me. If that phrase doesn’t make sense to you, I get it—it wouldn’t have to me either. But that’s the only way I can describe it. The effect comes with a deep sense of power and stillness.

After chanting this mantra on and off for over six months, the effects now seem to be accelerating. The biggest changes have been in my sense of **confidence**, **direction**, and **assertiveness**.

And while I can’t say for sure, I don’t think I would’ve even started this blog if not for this mantra.
